# Strategic Regulatory Submission Recommendations
**Generated:** 2026-02-09T14:32:46.779260
**Device Class:** Class II
**Target Markets:** FDA, EU_MDR, MFDS, PMDA, ANVISA

## Strategic Priorities

- **Speed:** 0.8/1.0
- **Cost:** 0.5/1.0
- **Risk:** 0.6/1.0

## Recommended Submission Strategy

**Strategy:** HYBRID
**Confidence:** 75.0%

### Rationale
Hybrid submission balances priorities (speed: 0.8, cost: 0.5). Wave-based approach for 5 markets. Medium complexity (60/100) suits hybrid approach.

### Implementation Notes
- Group markets by timeline similarity
- Wave 1: Fast-track markets (≤4 months)
- Wave 2: Medium-duration markets (5-8 months)
- Wave 3: Long-duration markets (>8 months)
- Scale resources between waves
- Use Wave 1 approvals to support subsequent waves

### Alternative Strategies
**Parallel:** When speed is critical and resources are available
**Sequential:** When resources are limited or learning from each submission is valuable
