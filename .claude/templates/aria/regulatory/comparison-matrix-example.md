## Identified Conflicts

### Clinical Evidence Requirements (MEDIUM)
**Affected Markets:** FDA, EU_MDR
**Description:** EU MDR requires more extensive clinical evidence than FDA 510(k)
**Impact:** Generate comprehensive clinical evaluation report (CER) per MEDDEV 2.7.1 rev 4, then extract relevant portions for FDA 510(k)

### Notified Body Availability (MEDIUM)
**Affected Markets:** EU_MDR
**Description:** EU MDR requires Notified Body certification, limited capacity
**Impact:** Engage Notified Body 12-18 months before planned submission, consider parallel FDA submission

### Local Clinical Data (MEDIUM)
**Affected Markets:** PMDA, MFDS
**Description:** Some markets require local clinical data
**Impact:** Plan multi-center clinical trials including sites in target markets, consider local data acceptance policies

## Harmonization Strategies

### For: Clinical Evidence Requirements
**Strategy:** Generate comprehensive clinical evaluation report (CER) per MEDDEV 2.7.1 rev 4
**Actions:**
- Create detailed CER with literature search
- Extract relevant portions for FDA 510(k)
- Maintain traceability matrix for clinical evidence
**Benefit:** Single comprehensive document serves multiple markets
**Effort:** HIGH - requires clinical expertise

### For: Notified Body Availability
**Strategy:** Early Notified Body engagement
**Actions:**
- Engage Notified Body 12-18 months before submission
- Parallel FDA submission while awaiting EU MDR approval
- Consider multiple Notified Body options
**Benefit:** Reduces EU MDR timeline through parallel processing
**Effort:** MEDIUM - requires planning and coordination
