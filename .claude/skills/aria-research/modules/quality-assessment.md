# Information Quality Assessment

Criteria for evaluating the authority, currency, applicability, and traceability of regulatory research sources.

## Quality Assessment Framework

### Four-Dimension Assessment

Every research source must be evaluated across four dimensions:

1. **Authority**: Is the source authoritative and official?
2. **Currency**: Is the information current and applicable?
3. **Applicability**: Is it relevant to the specific use case?
4. **Traceability**: Can the source be verified and accessed?

- Verify withdrawal status (some guidances are withdrawn)
- Review for replacement by newer guidance
- Check effective date and applicability

### Currency Indicators

**Green (Current):**
- Current effective version confirmed via Context7 or official source
- No superseding version published
- Applicable to current regulatory environment
- Referenced in recent submissions or approvals

**Yellow (Caution - Verify):**
- Version is current, but amendment or revision pending
- Guidance is in draft status
- Transition period in effect (old/new versions both valid)
- Limited recent usage or references

**Red (Outdated):**
- Superseded by newer version
- Withdrawn or obsolete

## Continuous Quality Verification

### Periodic Re-Assessment

Research sources should be re-assessed periodically:

- **Annual Review**: All Tier 1 and Tier 2 sources
- **Quarterly Review**: Draft guidance documents and pending standards
- **Upon Amendment**: Immediate review when source is amended
- **Before Submission**: Re-verify all sources before finalizing submission

### Quality Alerts

Set up alerts for quality-impacting events:

- Standard published (new version available)
- Guidance withdrawn or updated
- Regulation amended
- Harmonization status changed (EU standards)

### Quality Assurance Process

Before using any source in regulatory document:

1. Assess quality using four-dimension framework
2. Score each dimension (0-10)
3. Calculate composite quality score
4. Verify acceptability threshold (≥ 8.0 for submissions)
5. Document assessment in quality record
6. Re-verify currency via Context7 before final use
7. Include in traceability matrix with quality score
