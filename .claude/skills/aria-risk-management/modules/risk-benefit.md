# Risk-Benefit Analysis

## Overview

Risk-benefit analysis is the systematic evaluation of whether the clinical benefits of a medical device outweigh its risks.

## ALARP Principle

**As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP)**

Risk must be reduced to a level that is:
- **As low as possible** considering:
  - Technical feasibility
  - Economic cost
  - Implementation timeline
  - Regulatory requirements

### ALARP Evaluation Process

1. **Identify Risks**: List all identified risks
2. **Assess Risk Levels**: Determine severity and probability
3. **Consider Risk Controls**: Evaluate risk reduction options
4. **Implement Controls**: Apply risk control measures
5. **Residual Risk**: Evaluate remaining risk
6. **Benefit Analysis**: Quantify clinical benefits
7. **Compare Benefits to Risks**: Make benefit-risk determination

## Risk-Benefit Analysis Process

### Step 1: Identify Clinical Benefits

**Types of Clinical Benefits:**
- Diagnostic accuracy (improved diagnosis)
- Therapeutic efficacy (improved treatment outcomes)
- Patient outcomes (quality of life, survival)
- Public health impact (disease management)

**Quantification Methods:**
- Clinical trial data
- Literature review
- Expert consensus
- Real-world evidence

### Step 2: Identify Risks

**Types of Risks:**
- Device-related risks (technical failures)
- Procedure-related risks (complications)
- Patient-related risks (contra-indications)
- User-related risks (use errors)

### Step 3: Determine Benefit-Risk Ratio

**Ratio Calculation:**

```
Benefit-Risk Ratio = (Clinical Benefits × Probability of Success) / (Risks × Probability of Harm)
```

**Decision Criteria:**
- **Favorable**: Benefits clearly outweigh risks
- **Unfavorable**: Risks clearly outweigh benefits
- **Uncertain**: Insufficient data for determination

## Risk-Benefit Documentation

**Required Contents:**
- Statement of intended use
- Identification of risks and benefits
- Quantification of risks and benefits
- Comparison to alternative treatments
- Justification for benefit-risk determination

## Sequential Thinking Integration

**Complex Risk-Benefit Analysis:**

Use Sequential Thinking MCP when:
1. Multiple risks and benefits exist
2. Trade-offs between options are unclear
3. Stakeholder interests conflict
4. Long-term consequences uncertain

**Analysis Steps:**
1. Assumption Audit: What are we assuming about benefits and risks?
2. First Principles: What is the core clinical objective?
3. Alternative Generation: What are the alternative approaches?
4. Trade-off Analysis: How do we weigh different factors?
5. Bias Check: Are we biased toward certain outcomes?
