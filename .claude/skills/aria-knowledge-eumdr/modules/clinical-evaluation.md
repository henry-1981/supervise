# EU MDR Clinical Evaluation

## Overview

임상 평가 (Clinical Evaluation)는 MDR Article 61 및 Annex XIV에 정의된 핵심 요구사항입니다. 의료기기의 안전성과 성능을 임상 데이터를 통해 입증해야 합니다.

## Legal Basis

**Article 61: Clinical Evaluation**
- 제조사는 임상 평가를 수행하고 문서화해야 함
- 임상 평가 보고서 (CER) 작성 필요
- 임상 평가는 의료기기의 전체 수명주기 동안 지속

**Annex XIV: Clinical Evaluation**
- 임상 평가 절차 상세 기술
- 임상 조사 (Clinical Investigation) 요구사항

## Clinical Evaluation Process (MEDDEV 2.7/1 Rev 4)

### Step 1: Clinical Data Gathering

**Data Sources:**
1. **Literature Review**
   - PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library
   - Scientific conferences
   - Gray literature

2. **Manufacturer's Data**
   - Pre-clinical testing
   - Bench testing
   - Animal studies

3. **Clinical Investigation**
   - Prospective studies
   - Retrospective studies
   - Registry data

4. **Post-Market Data**
   - PMS (Post-Market Surveillance)
   - Complaint reports
   - Field safety corrective actions

### Step 2: Applicability Determination

**Equivalence Criteria (Annex XIV 1.3):**
1. **Same Clinical Condition**
   - Same target population
   - Same clinical objectives

2. **Same Technical Characteristics**
   - Similar design
   - Similar materials
   - Similar mechanism of action

3. **Same Safety & Performance**
   - Comparable safety profile
   - Equivalent performance

**Equivalent Device:**
- Legally marketed in EU
- No safety/performance issues
- Sufficient clinical data available

### Step 3: Data Analysis

**Quantitative Analysis:**
- Meta-analysis
- Systematic review
- Statistical significance testing

**Qualitative Analysis:**
- Expert consensus
- Clinical guidelines
- Best practices

**Outcome Measures:**
1. **Primary Endpoints**
   - Safety outcomes (Adverse events, complications)
   - Performance outcomes (Efficacy, functionality)

2. **Secondary Endpoints**
   - Patient-reported outcomes
   - Quality of life measures
   - Economic outcomes

### Step 4: Safety & Performance Demonstration

**Benefit-Risk Ratio:**
- Benefits must outweigh risks
- Risk minimization measures
- Acceptability of residual risks

**Acceptable Evidence:**
- Sufficient clinical data
- Robust methodology
- Peer-reviewed publications

## Clinical Investigation (CI)

### When is CI Required?

**Mandatory CI:**
- Class III devices
- Class IIb implantable devices
- Devices with novel technology
- Devices with insufficient existing data

**Exemptions:**
- Class I, IIa devices (with sufficient existing data)
- Well-established technology
- Established equivalence

### CI Study Design

**Study Types:**
1. **Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)**
   - Gold standard
   - Prospective, controlled
   - Randomized allocation

2. **Single-arm Study**
   - Historical control
   - Performance goal

3. **Registry Study**
   - Real-world evidence
   - Long-term follow-up

**Study Design Considerations:**
- Sample size calculation
- Inclusion/exclusion criteria
- Primary/secondary endpoints
- Follow-up duration
- Statistical analysis plan

### CI Application (Article 62)

**Application Contents:**
1. Investigation plan
2. Investigator brochure
3. Informed consent forms
4. Case report forms
5. Device information
6. Manufacture information

**Approval Process:**
- Competent Authority notification
- Ethics committee approval
- Notified Body review (for high-risk devices)

## Clinical Evaluation Report (CER)

### CER Structure

1. **Executive Summary**
   - Device description
   - Intended purpose
   - Clinical evaluation conclusion

2. **Introduction**
   - Device description
   - Intended purpose
   - Target population

3. **Methodology**
   - Literature search strategy
   - Data sources
   - Applicability criteria

4. **Clinical Data**
   - Literature review results
   - Manufacturer's data
   - Clinical investigation results

5. **Safety & Performance**
   - Benefit-risk analysis
   - Risk acceptance rationale
   - Risk mitigation measures

6. **Conclusion**
   - Compliance with GSPR (Annex I)
   - Recommendations for PMCF

### CER Update Schedule

**Required Updates:**
1. **Initial CER**: Before market entry
2. **Annual Update**: For Class III devices
3. **Periodic Update**: Every 2-5 years (risk-based)
4. **Event-Driven Update**: Significant changes, safety issues

## Post-Market Clinical Follow-up (PMCF)

### PMCF Plan (Article 61)

**Objectives:**
1. Confirm safety & performance
2. Identify emerging risks
3. Ensure acceptability of benefit-risk ratio
4. Detect long-term complications

**PMCF Activities:**
1. **Systematic data collection**
   - Registry studies
   - Post-market studies
   - Literature updates

2. **Regular review**
   - Annual PMCF report
   - CER update
   - PMS plan revision

3. **Trigger events**
   - Safety signals
   - Technological changes
   - New clinical evidence
