#### Step 2: Clinical Data Generation
1. Literature review
2. Clinical investigation (필요 시)
3. PMCF data collection
4. Equivalence assessment

#### Step 3: Clinical Data Analysis
1. Data quality assessment
2. Appraisal of clinical data
3. Benefit-risk analysis

#### Step 4: Clinical Evaluation Report
1. Summary of findings
2. Analysis of residual risks
3. Overall conclusions
4. Annex XIV checklist compliance

## Clinical Data Sources

### Literature Search
