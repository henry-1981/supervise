# ISO 14971:2019 - Risk Management

의료기기 위험 관리 표준.

## ISO 14971:2019 개요

**Purpose:** 의료기기 위험 관리 프로세스 요구사항

**Scope:** 모든 의료기기 및 IVD

**Key Changes from ISO 14971:2012**
- Risk-benefit analysis 강화
- Benefit-risk ratio clarification
- Total product lifecycle focus
- Risk management file requirements

## 위험 관리 프로세스

### 1. Risk Analysis (위험 분석)

#### 1.1 Intended Use
- 의도된 사용
- 합리하게 예측 가능한 오용

#### 1.2 Hazard Identification
- Hazard 식별
- Hazardous situations 식별
- Harm 식별

#### 1.3 Risk Estimation
- Severity (심각성) 평가
- Probability of occurrence (발생 확률) 평가

### 2. Risk Evaluation (위험 평가)

#### 2.1 Risk Index Calculation
```
Risk Index = Severity × Probability
```

#### 2.2 Risk Acceptability

| Risk Index | Acceptability |
|------------|---------------|
| 1-4 | Acceptable |
| 5-9 | ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Practicable) |
| 10-15 | Unacceptable |

### 3. Risk Control (위험 경감)

#### 3.1 Risk Control Options (Priority Order)
1. **Inherent Safety** (설계로 위험 제거)
2. **Protective Measures** (보호 장치)
3. **Information for Safety** (라벨링, IFU)

#### 3.2 Risk Control Measures
- Design modifications
- Protective measures
- Alarm systems
- Warning labels
- Training

### 4. Residual Risk Evaluation (잔여 위험 평가)

- Residual risk acceptability assessment
- Benefit-risk analysis
- ALARP principle application

### 5. Risk Management Report
- Risk management summary
- Residual risk disclosure
- Post-production monitoring

## Risk Analysis Methods

### FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis)

**FMEA Template:**

| Component | Failure Mode | Effect | Severity (1-5) | Probability (1-5) | Detection (1-5) | RPN | Control Measures |
|-----------|--------------|--------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----|-----------------|
| Power supply | Failure | No power | 3 | 2 | 2 | 12 | Backup battery |
| Sensor | Drift | Inaccurate reading | 4 | 3 | 2 | 24 | Calibration protocol |

**RPN (Risk Priority Number) = Severity × Probability × Detection**

### FTA (Fault Tree Analysis)

```
                 [Patient Harm]
                       |
        ┌──────────────┴──────────────┐
        |                             |
   [Device Failure]              [User Error]
        |                             |
    [Component A]                 [Misuse]
        |
   [Supplier Defect]
```

### HAZOP (Hazard and Operability Study)

**Guide Words:**
- NO (Not performing intended function)
- MORE (Quantitative increase)
- LESS (Quantitative decrease)
- PART OF (Missing component)
- REVERSE (Opposite action)
- OTHER THAN (Unexpected event)

## Risk Management File

### Risk Management Report Contents

1. **Risk Management Policy**
2. **Risk Management Team**
3. **Risk Management Plan**
4. **Risk Analysis**
5. **Risk Evaluation**
6. **Risk Control Measures**
7. **Residual Risk Assessment**
8. **Benefit-Risk Analysis**
9. **Post-Production Monitoring**
10. **Risk Management Review**

## Risk-Benefit Analysis

### Benefit Assessment
- Clinical benefits
- Patient outcomes
- Quality of life improvements

### Risk Assessment
- Known risks
- Potential risks
- Residual risks

### Benefit-Risk Ratio
```
Benefit-Risk Ratio = Clinical Benefits / Total Risks
```

**Decision Criteria:**
- Ratio > 1.0: Acceptable
- Ratio ≈ 1.0: Additional analysis needed
- Ratio < 1.0: Unacceptable

## ALARP Principle

### As Low As Reasonably Practicable

**ALARP Region:**
- Risk reduced as far as possible
- Cost of further reduction > Benefit gained

**ALARP Demonstration:**
- Risk reduction measures exhausted
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Industry standard practice
- Good engineering practice
